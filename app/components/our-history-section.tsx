                    <p className="text-lg">
                        At Cyke.life, we believe that every cyclist deserves a bike that’s as unique as their ride.
                        Whether you’re pushing for podiums, conquering mountain passes, or enjoying long days in the saddle,
                        your bike should be built around you—not a one-size-fits-all compromise.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p className="text-lg">
                        That’s why we created Cyke.life—a platform that puts you in control.
                        We give you the freedom to customize every detail, from your frame and groupset to the saddle width,
                        crank length, handlebar width, and stem length, ensuring a perfect fit and peak performance.
                        Our intuitive design tool lets you visualize your build in real time,
                        so your dream bike is exactly how you imagined it—both in function and style.

                        Cycling is more than just a sport—it’s a passion, a lifestyle, and a pursuit of perfection. Yet,
                        finding the right bike often means settling—whether it’s for generic builds, limited sizing options,
                        or unnecessary components. We created Cyke.life to change that.
